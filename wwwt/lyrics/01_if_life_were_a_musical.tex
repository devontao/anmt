%             if life were a musical\\
%             i could hear what he is thinking.\\
%             he'd sing his inner thoughts\\
%             while he's chewing and drinking.\\
%         }
%         \stanza{
%             if life were a musical\\
%             even though his words are brief,\\
%             i'd know his inner thoughts\\
%             were more than "burger bacon beef."\\

%                 i wish i could say it's a record:\\
%                 three minutes to judge a blind date,\\
%                 but already i know it's time now to go.\\
%                 here's someone i could learn to hate.\\

%         \stanza{
%             if life were a musical\\
%             then his subtext would be clear.\\
%             he'd dance his inner thoughts\\
%             to a click track in his ear.\\
