\init{LIN paces around the living room, thinking of his next greatest musical endeavor as LESLIE sits at his computer, deep in thought. LESLIE clacks away at his keyboard until Lin finally gets fed up.}

\lin
Will you stop that!

\les
Stop what?

\lin
Stop that stupid noise! I can't focus on writing my next great musical!

\les
Well can you stop pacing around? I can't focus on writing my next great typesetting software!

\lin
\aside{with frustration}
Alright, I've had enough of you.

\stagedir{LIN goes over to LESLIE's laptop, about to break it open.}

\les
Wait! What if we... joined forces?

\lin
What, you say?

\les
What if you... typeset your musical on my software?

\lin
Hmm... you may be onto something.
